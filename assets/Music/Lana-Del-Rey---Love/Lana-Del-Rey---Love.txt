Текст песни «Lana Del Rey - Love» 

Love (оригинал Lana Del Rey)

Look at you kids with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusing

It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazy

You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter cause it's enough
To be young and in love
To be young and in love

Look at you kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues
But that don't mean that you should abuse it

Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter cause it's enough
To be young and in love
To be young and in love

(Ah, ah)
Don't worry, baby
(Ah, ah)
Don't worry, baby
And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love
I'm young and in love

(Ah, ah)
Don't worry, baby
(Ah, ah)
Don't worry, baby
(Ah, ah)
Don't worry, baby
