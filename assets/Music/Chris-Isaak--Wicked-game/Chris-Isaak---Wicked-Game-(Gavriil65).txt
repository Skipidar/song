Текст песни «Chris Isaak - Wicked Game (Gavriil65)» 

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It’s strange what desire will make foolish people do
And I’d never dreamed that I’d knew somebody like you
And I’d never dreamed that I’d need somebody like you

No I don’t wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
No I don’t wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you
With you (this girl is only gonna break your heart)

What a wicked game you played to make me feel this way
what a wicked thing to do to let me dream of you
what a wicked thing to say you never felt this way
what a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you

And I don’t wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
No I don’t wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It’s strange what desire will make foolish people do
I’d never dreamed that I’d love somebody like you
I’d never dreamed that I’d lose somebody like you

No I don’t wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
No I don’t wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you (this girl is only gonna break your heart)
With you (this girl is only gonna break your heart)

No I... (this girl is only gonna break your heart)
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
Nobody loves no one
