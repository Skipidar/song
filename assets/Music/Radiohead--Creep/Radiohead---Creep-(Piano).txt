Текст песни «Radiohead - Creep (Piano)» 

When you were here before,
couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel,
your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather
in a beautiful world
I wish I was special,
you're so fucking special
[Chorus:]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts,
I want to have control
I want a perfect body,
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice when
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special,
I wish I was special
[Chorus:]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
O-oh, o-oh...
She's running out again
She's running out, she run, run, run, ru-u- -u-un!
Ru-u-u-un!..
Whatever makes you happy,
whatever you want
You're so f*cking special,
I wish I was special...
[Chorus:]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
