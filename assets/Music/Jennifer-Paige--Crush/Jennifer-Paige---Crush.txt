
See ya blowin' me a kiss
It doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's going on baby
If you see something in my eye
Let's not over analyze
Don't go too deep with it baby
So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss
And get crazy over you and me
Here's what I do, I play it loose
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint everytime we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha la la la, sha la la la
Sha la la la, sha la la la

It's raising my adrenaline
You're bangin' on a heart of tin
Please don't make too much of it baby
Say the word forevermore
That's not what I'm looking for
All I can commit to is maybe
So let it be what it'll be
Don't make a fuss
And get crazy over you and me
Here's what I do, I play it loose
Not like we have a date with destiny

It's just a little crush
Not like I faint everytime we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha la la la, sha la la la
Sha la la la, sha la la la

Vanilla skies, white picket fences in your eyes
A vision of you and me

It's just (aah) a little crush (crush)
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just (aah) some little thing (crush)
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha-la-la-la
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just (aah) some little thing
Not like everything I do depends on you
Sha-la-la-la
Not like I faint every time we touch
It's just (aah) some little thing
Not like everything I do
(fade)
